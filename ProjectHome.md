Sick of having to keep RSS feeds as bookmarks on the iPhone?
Don't like having to browse to a website to check your feeds?
Ever wanted a native RSS reader on the iPhone/Touch?

Well this project is here to fix all of that.

The goal of Mobile-RSS is to create a native iPhone application which will remember all your feeds and give you an easy interface for viewing, adding, and removing.

Mobile-RSS is part of the [MobileStudio](http://code.google.com/p/mobilestudio/)
